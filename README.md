January 22 2020.

I have stopped work on this site because how I would like the site to look involves advanced Vue and i am not yet at that stage.
things like shrinking the videobox using Vue transitions, I tried and It is not working. For the like of me I cant figure out why not.
keep alive the video on the home tab. even though I used the keep alive tags the videos pause. and finally the layout of the home page 
was palnned sloppily using absolute positions.
for these reasons I am not continuing. maybe some time in the future I'll come back and solve these issues
